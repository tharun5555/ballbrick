# Ball Brick

The program is written on Python3.
Question1,Question2,Question3,Question4,Question5 are the solutions to the given questions respectively. 
The combined file is **[Ball_Brick.py](/Ball_Brick.py)** 

# How to run

Since the program is written on Py3 to run the program 

>    `python3 Ball_Brick.py`

## Procedure

The program initially ask the size of the matrix NxN 

    Enter the size of your NxN matrix: 7

Then it asks to add bricks to the matrix 

    Do you want to add bricks? Y/N :  Y
    Enter the brick's position and the brick type : 2 2 1

The block location should be added space separated accompanied by the brick weight.

> Enter the brick's position and the brick type : [i] [j] [ weight]
Then the program prints the current game matrix

    W     W
    W 111 W
    W     W
    W     W
    W     W

The program asks the ball count

    Enter ball count :

The program ask if we want to traverse the ball 

    Do you want to traverse the ball ? Y/N :  Y
    Enter the direction in which the ball need to traverse : ST

There are three traverse mode

 - Straight -ST  
 - Left Diagonal- LD 
 - Right Diagonal- RD
